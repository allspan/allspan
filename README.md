# ⤚Allspan⤙ 
Naming and access control spanning every user and every service

## About
Allspan is yet only an imaginary project. Probably doable. Figuring that out is the [first task](https://github.com/allspan/allspan/issues/1) - discussion welcome!

## Project scope
Sharing should be easy, without requiring several steps and up- and downloading of the whole file contents. Allow privacy, by not requiring users to leak data or metadata, and become part of as big as practical anonymity set.

## Watercooler pitch
Allspan is multi-player, multi device, collaborative ASAP file sharing. Just Allspan your file or folder, then share the link. 

Automate away from emailing your stuff back and forth; downloading, copying along, only to be uploaded again. Download here, read a PDF there, archive it all anywhere. Set your data proliferation rules and priorities, or deafult to copy-on-read.

Sharing is caring. Help your fellow datanauts, tip your tapped data providers, anonymously. Curate files with friends, or gawk over strange data leaks or trends.

Each Allspan installation is part of a whole, and with a chance to access all data that has ever been allspanned. Keep your share links and keys dear, don't let any event horizon separate you from your data, on that the data, and metadata, additional backups be with you: find the metadata, then put up a download contract or shut up; no excessive gossiping, and net neutrality for all.

The true data is out there. Trustevery1, but verify: that the data is its content hash, and the content hash its handle for the data. 

One keyring to rule your metadata, one trustring to find it, one ring of fetchers to bring the referenced data, and into your plural backup solutions bind it, in your datascapes, where your data shadows and indexes lie.

On the path of trust, your claims cost goodwills, and your metadata pays in goodwills. Route your trust, and trust your route, on that the metadata be the frenemy of your privacy, and may the data source be with you, lest your data depend on the mercy of r/datahoarders - fragmented, fractally compressed, interpolated with or without lossyness. The true data is out there.

There `is to be created` a well-documented API that supports import/export to commonly used data exchange formats. And if the built-in feature set isn't enough for you, there `will hopefully be` plugins that allow you to customize your installation to suit your needs.

You _won't need to set up a server and_ install Allspan in order to use it. Just pick one of publicly available instances that friendly people from everywhere around this on-world civilization have set up. Alternatively, you can set up your own instance by following [our installation guide](https://github.com/allspan/allspan/blob/master/INSTALL.md).

## Intended use-cases
- allspan [file or folder]
- allspan -w [folder]
- allspan --new
- allspan --status
- allspan --backup
- allspan --rescan [[optional paths]\*]
- allspan --verify [file or folder]
- allspan --reach [file or folder]

## "Pull Requests welcome" use-cases
- fetchers and other integration with storage solutions
- adapters to projects that supply adapters to (optionally dumb) file or block storage

## Explicitly out of scope
- NIH or reinventing and rebuilding reasonably usable existing software
- the kitchen sink

## Inspirations
- Exomemory, as described by Greg Egan.
- Gestalt objects, as described by Hannu R.
- Oubliette reality overlay access control, as described by Iain M Banks.
- Event bubbles, as described by https://github.com/matshenricson/xyztr

## Installation

### Mac
Once it gets released, the installation should be as easy as `brew install allspan`

### Linux/Mac
Once it gets released, you should be able to install the package `allspan` from your distributions unofficial package repository.

### Windows
Once it gets released, the installation should be as easy as `choco install allspan`

## Contribute
Allspan is an ad hoc, open sourced, project. If you ❤ this project, we'd ❤ to see your contributions! It doesn't matter who you are, what you know or what you have to offer. There are plenty of ways to be helpful!

First off, please get well accustomed to our software. Maybe watch some screencast or look at what's being discussed, to get a more wholesome image of what allspan encompasses and spans over. Read and learn about it, evangelise it, and engage with the community. You can also translate the user interface to your mother tongue or learn how to write adapters. Be creative!
If you'd like to help but don't have any idea how or what is needed, get in touch! The wiki is a good starting place.

## Development workflow
The main development happens on Github. To contribute, fork the main repo, branch off a feature branch from develop, make your changes and commit them, push to your fork and submit a pull request to the main git repository.

## Stable releases
Once in a while we merge develop into master, which results in a new release. This means you will always find the latest stable version in the master branch.
