## Watercooler pitch
No more sending your stuff back and forth via email, just get your file or folder Allspanned, share the link, then get back to work!

Allspan allows you to share files and folders collaboratively and ASAP, almost like a live multi-player file system. You're welcome and enabled to send tips to good sharers, and welcome to pay forward the <3, since sharing is caring. Write articles, press releases, to-do lists, etc. together with your friends, fellow colleagues, or strangers, all accessing the same collections.

All Allspan installations have a possibility to access all data that has ever been allspanned, assuming you've not lost the share link or your login keys.

There `is to be created` a well-documented API that supports import/export to commonly used data exchange formats. And if the built-in feature set isn't enough for you, there `will hopefully be` plugins that allow you to customize your installation to suit your needs.

You `won't need to set up a server and` install Allspan in order to use it. Just pick one of publicly available instances that friendly people from everywhere around the world have set up. Alternatively, you can set up your own instance by following our installation guide.

## Installation

### Mac
Once it gets released, the installation should be as easy as `brew install allspan`

### Linux/Mac
Once it gets released, you should be able to install the package `allspan` from your distributions unofficial package repository.

### Windows
Once it gets released, the installation should be as easy as `choco install allspan`

## Contribute
Allspan is an ad hoc, open sourced, project. If you ❤ this project, we'd ❤ to see your contributions! It doesn't matter who you are, what you know or what you have to offer. There are plenty of ways to be helpful!

First off, please get well accustomed to our software. Maybe watch some screencast or look at what's being discussed, to get a more wholesome image of what allspan encompasses and spans over. Read and learn about it, evangelise it, and engage with the community. You can also translate the user interface to your mother tongue or learn how to write adapters. Be creative!
If you'd like to help but don't have any idea how or what is needed, get in touch! The wiki is a good starting place.

## Development workflow
The main development happens on Github. To contribute, fork the main repo, branch off a feature branch from develop, make your changes and commit them, push to your fork and submit a pull request to the main git repository.

## Stable releases
Once in a while we merge develop into master, which results in a new release. This means you will always find the latest stable version in the master branch.
