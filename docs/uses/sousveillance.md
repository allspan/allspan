# Sousveillance

_"The watched watches the watchers"_

## Voluntary key backup
Users could voluntarily deposit or backup some or all keys with a lawyer or priest, to potentially have some interesting legal protections.

## Legally privileged key custodians
Having a key custodian for some of your keys creates alternatives to keep societies functional with less top-down surveillance, more comunity-based enforcing of policy, like humans have been used to. If it can be tweaked to create a feeling of attachment and belonging to the local community, that brings important and good psychological effects.

## Data gathering, good and bad
Say you've uploaded photos from a crisis zone. An automatic police request to all who keep deposited keys+metadata is issued to all (voluntarily?) registered depositors. Maybe you had pre-approved to sharing photos for that kind of requests. Then the relevant photos could be shared straight into the police case, maybe with watermarking that it's not approved to be used for anything else.
Or your father in law, a police officer, just "happens" to requests all your photos. You might want to not auto-accept, instead requesting clarification maybe from another officer, or apply some legal fairness test, preventing power abuse. Maybe a request is tailored to request photos from everyone except you + your near contacts, along a locatoin-timeline matching yours. An automatic abuse checking system at your depositor's could flag such a request to be delayed and inspected to limit abuse.
