## Design assumptions

### Not like Camlistore
The opposite of [Camlistore's assumptions](https://github.com/camlistore/camlistore/blob/master/doc/overview.txt) while still agreeing with [Camlistore's principles](https://github.com/camlistore/camlistore/blob/master/doc/principles.md):
* diskspace is limited _in practice_
* bandwidth is metered
* CPU feels too slow
* people can't safely store private keys

### Additional assumtions
* battery juice is precious
* someone is watching and storing all connection metadata on internet and other public networks
* democracy and freedom maybe won't last
* unfiying filesystems and naming is hard
* once a something is shared, or viewed in public, don't rely on it still being private (analog loopholes, targeted crypto analysis and XOR) 

## Goals (measurables)
- store only data you care about (disk usage(private fullsync allspan instance) <= disk usage(same data minus allspan's added functionalities and underlying data)
- nibmle (<10 kLOC)
- standards compliant (prefer tools and protocols with semver ">=1.0")
- automatic and adhoc naming (user can define part of the name, but isn't forced to resolve naming conflict. Adding (1) or (Copy)is technically allowed here, but frowned upon)
- anonymity (leak less metadata than if you'd be using Signal chat app)
- incremental sharing (adding a participant can't disrupt previous users)
- data integrity (verifiable chain of custody of file metadata, which verifiably matches the covered data)
- (partial) recoverability of data referenced in my non-private indexes also if my private key for the metadaa and my decryption keys are lost (local index has references which can be matched to willing participants, enabling data arhaeology or recovering photoalbums)

## Stretch goals (measurables)
. dead mans switch (a user who's not routable - i.e. offline - for a defined time triggers release of some decryption keys)
- recreate lost decryption keys (reset or recreate user secrets from userfile-at-rest and saved recovery phrase)
- burn a previous i.e. exposed gestalt key (a gestalt revocation message can be published)
- integration with messengers and social walled gardens (maybe a browser extension that snaps up any postsed text and media)
- device independent (an allspin user can use all functionality via a public computer on an untrusteed open network. Visual/audio for ex/infil of data through the untrusted device is allowed)
- managed diska space (data is deduped, avoiding storing widely high bandwidth-available public data, and/or farming out storage to friends and paid storages)

## Differences to related _open_ solutions
* [Camlistore's design](https://github.com/camlistore/camlistore/blob/master/doc/arch.md) gives you a server or service-based storage solution to last a lifetime, with considerations for not complicating future data arhealogy. Do read it's full [raison d'Ã¨tre](https://github.com/camlistore/camlistore/blob/master/doc/overview.md)
* [Upspin](http://upspin.io) is a global naming solution for files and users, meant to be usable across online services and walled garden social platforms.
* [Hashbackup](http://www.hashbackup.com/home/features) is Dropbox minus the sharing, and likely feature completed.
* (Diaspora*)[https://wiki.diasporafoundation.org/Architecture_overview] is a good data transport, but routing is federated. Profile, sharing etc was _initially_ designed very close to something Allspan could be built on top of. It ticks many boxes, but requires trusted system operators.

## Useful technologies
- signed, traceable chain of claims, built like https://help.github.com/articles/signing-commits-with-gpg/
- [SQRL](https://www.grc.com/sqrl/sqrl.htm) for Gestalt keys, and possibly to help people store private keys
- [Snappy compression](https://google.github.io/snappy/) for cpu-friendly space/&time saving
- private long-term routing by [paid remailers](http://nakamotoinstitute.org/for-pay-remailers/)

## Prior art in a wide sense
- What's at https://github.com/camlistore/camlistore/blob/master/doc/prior-art.md
- All mentions under [Diff. to realted solutions](https://github.com/allspan/allspan/blob/master/docs/arch.md#differences-to-related-open-solutions)
- File sync and dropbox services
- [Android Syncbase](https://vanadium.github.io/syncbase/) is offline-first P2P backup.
- storing and sharing solutions; FreeNet, Gnutella, Napster, BitTorrent, tor, i2p, IPFS, Storj, Sia
- social networks, and Diaspora*, Identi.ca, Voat, etc

## Important processes (protocol)
To be defined:
- finding routes
- offering blobs
- sharing metadata
- fetching a file

## Security
- Use only battle hardened crypto and in the same way as it's used elsewhere by bigger targets. Compare Bitcoin SHA256 and EC.
- E2E and encrypted-at-rest


### Access control
Compare https://github.com/upspin/upspin/blob/master/doc/security.md and https://github.com/upspin/upspin/blob/master/doc/access_control.md

### Anonymity


## New terminology
- What [Camlistory said](https://github.com/camlistore/camlistore/blob/master/doc/terms.md) about blob, blogref, blob server, schema blob, claim, permanode, sync
- polis
- blocks
- exomemory
- Gestalt objects
- Oubliette access control (original phrase?)
- Event bubbles
- event horizon
- ASAP sharing
- trustring
- ring of fetchers
- datascapes
- goodwills
- trust route
- your routes

### Preexisting computer science jargon
- anonymity set
- metadata
- keyring
- download contract
- gossiping (protocol)
- plural backup solutions
- bound data
- content hash
- datahoarder
- datanaut
- FIDOnet
- remailer
